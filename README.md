# Project 2: Website with a Search Engine
*By: Selena Pham*


The project pulls and displays gifs from the Giphy database.

## How to Use
The user can generate a random gif with the random button or search the gif library using a keyword. The user can input their search term in the search bar then click the translate button for a single result or the search button for a list of results shown 10 at a time. The left and right pagination buttons let the user browse through the list of results.

## Coded In
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Future Improvements
- [ ] Use a form on the search bar to search for gifs by submitting
- [ ] Organize the search results into columns for a cleaner look
- [ ] Turn the returned gifs into links back to their Giphy page
